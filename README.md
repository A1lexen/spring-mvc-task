Set-up a Spring MVC application for uploading/reading files.
The application should provide endpoints for the following actions:
  * Upload file to the server. The endpoint should consume the name with which the file is gonna be saved on the server and the file itself
  * Download file from the server. The endpoint will consume the filename and return the file
  * Update file. This will simply allow to change the filename
  * Delete file
  * Get file's short info. This will return the file size, its name and path

Deadline: before the academy ends :)
